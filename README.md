# Intro
Well i'm a die hard fan of Star Wars, and i really like programming in python, so i made a game for that! Hope u guys like it! 

# StarWars.py
This is a simple game developed in Python using the turtle graphics library. It is a space-themed game where the player controls a spaceship and tries to shoot down asteroids while avoiding collision with them. The player moves the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys and fires missiles using the space bar. The asteroids move randomly and get faster as the game progresses. If the player collides with an asteroid, the game ends and the final score is displayed. The game is built using object-oriented programming concepts, with classes for the player, missiles, and asteroids. Overall, it's a fun little game for anyone interested in simple game development using Python.
